      This is not your usual chicken Parmesan! Instead, chicken tenders are
      coated in grated Parmesan cheese and Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, fried
      until golden and crisp, and finished in a lovely garlicky cream sauce. So
      delicious!
    </h2>
    <p>
      To help create an extra crispy texture, pat the chicken dry, and season
      with salt and pepper. Then, place flour in one bowl, beaten eggs in
      another, and your panko mix in the third, which is a combination of grated
      Parmesan cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and smoked paprika. Dredge
      your chicken and fry in a skillet with butter and oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you finish frying the chicken and have set all pieces aside, add
      garlic and seasonings as well as white wine to deglaze the pan, stirring
      up all the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in heavy
      cream next and bring to a boil. Return your chicken to the pan and reheat
      until ready to serve. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator
      for about three to four days.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenders</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
      <li>parchment paper</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided, or more as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pat chicken tenders dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt
        and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour on a shallow plate. Place beaten eggs into a shallow bowl.
        Combine grated Parmesan cheese, Italian-seasoned panko crumbs, and 1
        teaspoon smoked paprika, and place on a second shallow plate.
      </li>
      <li>Cover a dinner plate or platter with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>
        Dip each lightly seasoned chicken breast tender in flour, shaking off
        the excess. Next, dip in beaten egg, and hold the tender over the eggs
        to allow excess to drip back into the bowl. Place each tender on the
        panko mixture. With dry fingers, scoop panko mix over the tender,
        patting the crumbs in. Place on the parchment-covered plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with remaining chicken tenders, until all tenders are breaded
        with flour, egg, and panko mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet
        over medium heat until butter is bubbling. Add tenders, 1 at a time,
        being careful not to crowd the skillet. You may need to cook chicken in
        2 batches. Cook until breading is browned and chicken is no longer pink
        in the center and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 minutes per side, being
        careful not to burn the breading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn tenders when the crust is nicely browned and continue cooking until
        an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Adjust heat down a notch or two, if
        the crust is getting too brown, and add a bit more oil or butter, if the
        skillet looks dry. Remove cooked chicken to a cooling rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add garlic to the skillet, and stir until garlic is fragrant, 30 to 45
        seconds. Deglaze skillet with white wine, stirring up all the browned
        bits from the bottom of the skillet. Season Italian herb seasoning blend
        and red pepper flakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in cream and heat over medium high. Bring sauce to a boil, stirring
        frequently, and adjust flavor with salt and pepper, if needed. Allow
        sauce to bubble until desired consistency is achieved, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return cooked chicken tenders to the skillet and warm in the sauce,
        about 1 minute. Garnish with fresh parsley.
